**Samples** is a collection of example projects that use [Material](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Material), [Motion](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Motion), [Graph](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Graph), and [Algorithm](https://github.com/CosmicMind/Algorithm).

### Photos Sample

### Graph Search

Using the **Graph Search** API is incredibly flexible. In the following example, Search is used to create a live search on user names with a dynamic UI provided by [Material's SearchBar](http://cosmicmind.com/material/searchbar).
